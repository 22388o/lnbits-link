# lnbits-link

Lightweight browser plugin for LNbits that allows the user to connect to an existing **LNbits** server and make payments in the browser.

This extension does **not** require for the user to configure a Lightning Network node or to manage channels.
Motivation:
  - for a **non-technical** user it is difficul to configure and manage a LN node
  - for a **technical user** it is easy to add a LNbits server next to the LN node
