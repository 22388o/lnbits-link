Light browser extensions for **[LNbits](https://lnbits.org/)** that allows the user to connect to any existing **[LNbits](https://lnbits.org/)** server and make payments in the browser. It supports:
  - [x] BOLT11 invoices
  - [x] LNURL-Pay

This extension does **not** require for the user to configure a Lightning Network node or to manage Payment Channels.

**Motivation**:
